// Package execguard decides whether a detector may safely launch a
// third-party binary on this machine.
//
// On macOS, executing a quarantined binary (com.apple.quarantine xattr, set
// by browser downloads and Homebrew cask installs) makes Gatekeeper assess
// it; when the binary or a native library it loads is not notarized, the OS
// shows a "could not verify … free of malware / Move to Bin" dialog in the
// logged-in user's session — a scary popup for something the user never ran
// themselves. SafeToExec answers, without any UI side effects, whether that
// would happen, so version probes can skip the exec (reporting "unknown")
// instead of triggering it. This generalizes the existing IsAppleCLTStub
// guard (which prevents the analogous Command Line Tools install prompt).
//
// On Linux the cause differs and the effect is the same: a packaged Electron
// app does not implement --version (only the unpackaged `electron` binary's
// default app does), so the flag is ignored and its window opens on the user's
// desktop. Reported by an Ubuntu 22.04 customer via LM Studio.

// SafeToExec reports whether launching binaryPath is safe from a
// GUI-popup perspective, and when it is not, why. Windows always returns true.
//
// The reason is returned rather than left to callers to describe: they log it,
// and the cause is platform-specific, so a hardcoded message goes stale the
// moment a platform is added. It is "" when safe.
//
// On macOS it resolves symlinks, then checks the binary and its containing
// directory for the com.apple.quarantine attribute (cask installs quarantine
// the whole install tree, so the parent dir catches partially-cleared
// installs). Unquarantined binaries are safe: Gatekeeper only assesses
// quarantined files. For quarantined ones, `spctl --assess --type execute`
// gives Gatekeeper's verdict silently — accepted means executing shows no
// popup; rejected (or any spctl failure, conservatively) means skip.
//
// Both probes execute only Apple-provided utilities (/usr/bin/xattr,
// /usr/sbin/spctl), which carry none of the third-party-binary risk this
// package exists to avoid.
