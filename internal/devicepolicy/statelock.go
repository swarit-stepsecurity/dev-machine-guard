// stateLockSuffix names the lock artifact guarding the state file's
// read-modify-write. It sits beside the state file (device-policy-state.json ->
// device-policy-state.json.lock) and carries NO policy state whatsoever — it
// exists only to hold an OS advisory lock, so every category's ownership record
// still lives in exactly one JSON file.
const stateLockSuffix = ".lock"

// stateLockWait bounds how long a read-modify-write waits for a concurrent agent
// process to finish its own before giving up and failing the operation. The
// critical section is a small read, an in-memory map edit and an atomic rename —
// microseconds — so the budget is deliberately orders of magnitude larger than
// honest contention needs: it has to absorb a rename serialized behind on-access
// antivirus, a slow network home directory, or a descheduled peer without ever
// mistaking one for a wedged process. Anything still holding it after this is not
// contention, and proceeding anyway would be the lost update the lock exists to
// prevent.
//
// stateLockRetryDelay is the poll interval. The lock is taken non-blocking and
// retried rather than waited on in the kernel so the budget is enforceable on
// both platforms with the same code.

// withStateLock runs fn holding an exclusive cross-process lock on the state
// file, then releases it. It is what makes a read-modify-write safe between
// separate agent PROCESSES: the in-process cacheMu cannot see a second agent, and
// without it an IDE reconcile in one process and an npm reconcile in another could
// each read the file, add their own category, and have the later atomic rename
// drop the earlier one's record — a silent loss of ownership that strands whatever
// that category wrote on disk, since the agent will not later remove a value it
// has no record of writing.
//
// Acquisition FAILS CLOSED: if the lock cannot be taken, fn does not run and the
// error is returned. The one file holding every category's ownership is an
// invariant, not a best effort, and "the lock was busy" is precisely the state in
// which a concurrent writer is proven to exist — proceeding there is the one case
// that can actually lose a record. The cost is accepted deliberately: the caller
// classifies the failure write_failed, which for npm rolls the ~/.npmrc block back
// and reports a failure the next cycle retries. A reported, recoverable failure is
// preferable to silently dropping another category's ownership.
//
// The single exception is a platform or filesystem with no advisory locking at all
// (see lockUnavailable): there fn runs unlocked, because no peer can hold a lock
// either — there is no race to lose, and failing closed would permanently break
// state persistence on that machine instead of protecting anything.
//
// Callers hold cacheMu first and this second, always in that order, so the two
// can never deadlock against each other. Neither lock is reentrant: fn must use
// the unlocked readStateFile / persistStateFile, never the public accessors.
